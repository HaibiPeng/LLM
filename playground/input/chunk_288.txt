Gollum was the first to get up. Spluttering and cursing he rose, and without a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours. Frodo and Sam crawled after him, until they came to a wide almost circular pit, high-banked upon the west. It was cold and dead, and a foul sump of oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom. In this evil hole they cowered, hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the Eye. The day passed slowly. A great thirst troubled them, but they drank only a few drops from their bottles-last filled in the gully, which now as they looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty. The hobbits took it in turn to watch. At first, tired as they were, neither of them could sleep at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow moving cloud, Sam dozed. It was Frodo's turn to bc on guard. He lay back on the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him. He looked up at the smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark riding shapes, and faces out of the past. He lost count of time, hovering between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him. Suddenly Sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling. It was evening. Frodo could not have called, for he had fallen asleep, and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit. Gollum was by him. For a moment Sam thought that he was trying to rouse Frodo; then he saw that it was not so. Gollum was talking to himself. Sm�agol was holding a debate with some other thought that used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss. A pale light and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke. `Sm�agol promised,' said the first thought. `Yes, yes, my precious,' came the answer, 'we promised: to save our Precious, not to let Him have it � never. But it's going to Him yes, nearer every step. What's the hobbit going to do with it, we wonders, yes we wonders.' `I don't know. I can't help it. Master's got it. Sm�agol promised to help the master.' `Yes, yes, to help the master: the master of the Precious. But if we was master, then we could help ourselfs, yes, and still keep promises.' `But Sm�agol said he would be very very good. Nice hobbit! He took cruel rope off Sm�agol's leg. He speaks nicely to me.' 'Very very good, eh, my precious? Let's be good, good as fish, sweet one, but to ourselfs. Not hurt the nice hobbit, of course, no, no.' `But the Precious holds the promise,' the voice of Sm�agol objected. `Then take it,' said the other, `and let's hold it ourselfs! Then we shall be master, _gollum_! Make the other hobbit, the nasty suspicious hobbit, make him crawl, yes, _gollum_!' `But not the nice hobbit? ' `Oh no, not if it doesn't please us. Still he's a Baggins, my precious, yes, a Baggins. A Baggins stole it. He found it and he said nothing, nothing. We hates Bagginses.' 'No, not this Baggins.' 'Yes, every Baggins. All peoples that keep the Precious. We must have it! ' `But He'll see, He'll know. He'll take it from us! ' 'He sees. He knows. He heard us make silly promises � against His orders, yes. Must take it. The Wraiths are searching. Must take it.' 'Not for Him! ' 'No, sweet one. See, my precious: if we has it, then we can escape, even from Him, eh? Perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than Wraiths. Lord Sm�agol? Gollum the Great? _The_ Gollum! Eat fish every day, three times a day; fresh from the sea. Most Precious Gollum! Must have it. We wants it, we wants it, we wants it! ' 'But there's two of them. They'll wake too quick and kill us,' whined Sm�agol in a last effort. `Not now. Not yet.' 'We wants it! But' � and here there was a long pause, as if a new thought had wakened. `Not yet, eh? Perhaps not. She might help. She might, yes.' `No, no! Not that way! ' wailed Sm�agol. `Yes! We wants it! We wants it! ' Each time that the second thought spoke, Gollum's long hand crept out slowly, pawing towards Frodo, and then was drawn back with a jerk as Sm�agol spoke again. Finally both arms, with long fingers flexed and twitching, clawed towards his neck. Sam had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move that Gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids. To his simple mind ordinary hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief danger in Gollum. He realized now that it was not so: Gollum was feeling the terrible call of the Ring. The Dark Lord was _He_, of course; but Sam wondered who _She_ was. One of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings, he supposed. Then he forgot the point, for things had plainly gone far enough, and were getting dangerous. A great heaviness was in all his limbs, but he roused himself with an effort and sat up. Something warned him to be careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate. He let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn. `What's the time? ' he said sleepily. Gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth. He stood up for a moment, tense and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all fours and crawling up the bank of the pit. 'Nice hobbits! Nice Sam! ' he said. 'Sleepy heads, yes, sleepy heads! Leave good Sm�agol to watch! But it's evening. Dusk is creeping. Time to go.' `High time! ' thought Sam. 'And time we parted, too.' Yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed Gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them.
