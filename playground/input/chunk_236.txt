Suddenly he lifted the blade and swung it shimmering and whistling in the air. Then he gave a great cry. His voice rang clear as he chanted in the tongue of Rohan a call to arms. _Arise now, arise, Riders of Th�oden! Dire deeds awake, dark is it eastward. Let horse be bridled, horn be sounded! Forth Eorlingas!_ The guards, thinking that they were summoned, sprang up the stair. They looked at their lord in amazement, and then as one man they drew their swords and laid them at his feet. 'Command us!' they said. '_Westu Th�oden h�l!_' cried �omer. 'It is a joy to us to see you return into your own. Never again shall it be said, Gandalf, that you come only with grief!' 'Take back your sword, �omer, sister-son!' said the king. 'Go, H�ma, and seek my own sword! Gr�ma has it in his keeping. Bring him to me also. Now, Gandalf, you said that you had counsel to give, if I would hear it. What is your counsel?' 'You have yourself already taken it,' answered Gandalf. 'To put your trust in �omer, rather than in a man of crooked mind. To cast aside regret and fear. To do the deed at hand. Every man that can ride should be sent west at once, as �omer counselled you: we must first destroy the threat of Saruman, while we have time. If we fail, we fall. If we succeed � then we will face the next task. Meanwhile your people that are left, the women and the children and the old, should stay to the refuges that you have in the mountains. Were they not prepared against just such an evil day as this? Let them take provision, but delay not, nor burden themselves with treasures, great or small. It is their lives that are at stake.' 'This counsel seems good to me now,' said Th�oden. 'Let all my folk get ready! But you my guests-truly you said, Gandalf, that the courtesy of my hall is lessened. You have ridden through the night, and the morning wears away. You have had neither sleep nor food. A guest-house shall be made ready: there you shall sleep, when you have eaten.' 'Nay, lord,' said Aragorn. 'There is no rest yet for the weary. The men of Rohan must ride forth today, and we will ride with them, axe, sword, and bow. We did not bring them to rest against your wall, Lord of the Mark. And I promised �omer that my sword and his should be drawn together.' 'Now indeed there is hope of victory!' said �omer. 'Hope, yes,' said Gandalf. 'But Isengard is strong. And other perils draw ever nearer. Do not delay, Th�oden, when we are gone. Lead your people swiftly to the Hold of Dunharrow in the hills!' 'Nay, Gandalf!' said the king. 'You do not know your own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall in the front of the battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.' 'Then even the defeat of Rohan will be glorious in song,' said Aragorn. The armed men that stood near clashed their weapons, crying: 'The Lord of the Mark will ride! Forth Eorlingas!' 'But your people must not be both unarmed and shepherdless' said Gandalf. 'Who shall guide them and govern them in your place?' 'I will take thought for that ere I go,' answered Th�oden. 'Here comes my counsellor.' At that moment H�ma came again from the hall. Behind him cringing between two other men, came Gr�ma the Wormtongue. His face was very white. His eyes blinked in the sunlight. H�ma knelt and presented to Th�oden a long sword in a scabbard clasped with gold and set with green gems. 'Here, lord, is Herugrim, your ancient blade,' he said. 'It was found in his chest. Loth was he to render up the keys. Many other things are there which men have missed.' 'You lie,' said Wormtongue. 'And this sword your master himself gave into my keeping.' 'And he now requires it of you again,' said Th�oden. 'Does that displease you?' 'Assuredly not. lord,' said Wormtongue. 'I care for you and yours as best I may. But do not weary yourself, or tax too heavily your strength. Let others deal with these irksome guests. Your meat is about to be set on the board. Will you not go to it?' 'I will,' said Th�oden. 'And let food for my guests be set on the board beside me. The host rides today. Send the heralds forth! Let them summon all who dwell nigh! Every man and strong lad able to bear arms, all who have horses, let them be ready in the saddle at the gate ere the second hour from noon!' 'Dear lord!' cried Wormtongue. 'It is as I feared. This wizard has bewitched you. Are none to be left to defend the Golden Hall of your fathers, and all your treasure? None to guard the Lord of the Mark?' 'If this is bewitchment,' said Th�oden, 'it seems to me more wholesome than your whisperings. Your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on all fours like a beast. No, not one shall be left, not even Gr�ma. Gr�ma shall ride too. Go! You have yet time to clean the rust from your sword.' 'Mercy, lord!' whined Wormtongue, grovelling on the ground. 'Have pity on one worn out in your service. Send me not from your side! I at least will stand by you when all others have gone. Do not send your faithful Gr�ma away!' 'You have my pity,' said Th�oden. 'And I do not send you from my side. I go myself to war with my men. I bid you come with me and prove your faith.' Wormtongue looked from face to face. In his eyes was the hunted look of a beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies. He licked his lips with a long pale tongue.
