'That would do. So you live in holes, eh? It sounds very right and proper. Who calls you _hobbits_, though? That does not sound elvish to me. Elves made all the old words: they began it.' 'Nobody else calls us hobbits; we call ourselves that,' said Pippin. 'Hoom, hmm! Come now! Not so hasty! You call _yourselves_ hobbits? But you should not go telling just anybody. You'll be letting out your own right names if you're not careful.' 'We aren't careful about that,' said Merry. 'As a matter of fact I'm a Brandybuck, Meriadoc Brandybuck, though most people call me just Merry.' 'And I'm a Took, Peregrin Took, but I'm generally called Pippin, or even Pip.' 'Hm, but you _are_ hasty folk, I see,' said Treebeard. 'I am honoured by your confidence; but you should not be too free all at once. There are Ents and Ents, you know; or there are Ents and things that look like Ents but ain't, as you might say. I'll call you Merry and Pippin if you please � nice names. For I am not going to tell you my name, not yet at any rate.' A queer half-knowing, half-humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes. 'For one thing it would take a long while: my name is growing all the time, and I've lived a very long, long time; so _my_ name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish as you might say. It is a lovely language, but it takes a very long time to say anything in it, because we do not say anything in it, unless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to. 'But now,' and the eyes became very bright and 'present', seeming to grow smaller and almost sharp, 'what is going on? What are you doing in it all? I can see and hear (_and_ smell _and_ feel) a great deal from this, from this, from this_ a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lind-or-bur�m�_. Excuse me: that is a part of my name for it; I do not know what the word is in the outside languages: you know, the thing we are on, where I stand and look out on fine mornings, and think about the Sun, and the grass beyond the wood, and the horses, and the clouds, and the unfolding of the world. What is going on? What is Gandalf up to? And these � _bur�rum_,' he made a deep rumbling noise like a discord on a great organ � 'these Orcs, and young Saruman down at Isengard? I like news. But not too quick now.' 'There is quite a lot going on,' said Merry: 'and even if we tried to be quick, it would take a long time to tell. But you told us not to be hasty. Ought we to tell you anything so soon? Would you think it rude, if we asked what you are going to do with us, and which side you are on? And did you know Gandalf?' 'Yes, I do know him: the only wizard that really cares about trees ' said Treebeard. 'Do you know him?' 'Yes,' said Pippin sadly, 'we did. He was a great friend, and he was our guide.' 'Then I can answer your other questions,' said Treebeard. 'I am not going to do anything _with_ you: not if you mean by that 'do something _to_ you' without your leave. We might do some things together. I don't know about _sides_. I go my own way; but your way may go along with mine for a while. But you speak of Master Gandalf, as if he was in a story that had come to an end.' 'Yes, we do,' said Pippin sadly. 'The story seems to be going on, but I am afraid Gandalf has fallen out of it.' 'Hoo, come now!' said Treebeard. 'Hoom, hm, ah well.' He paused, looking long at the hobbits: 'Hoom, ah, well I do not know what to say. Come now!' 'If you would like to hear more. said Merry, 'we will tell you. But it will take some time. Wouldn't you like to put us down? Couldn't we sit here together in the sun, while it lasts? You must be getting tired of holding us up.' 'Hm, _tired_? No. I am not tired. I do not easily get tired. And I do not sit down. I am not very, hm, bendable. But there, the Sun _is_ going in. Let us leave this � did you say what you call it?' 'Hill?' suggested Pippin. 'Shelf? Step?' suggested Merry. Treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully. '_Hill_. Yes, that was it. But it is a hasty word for a thing that has stood here ever since this part of the world was shaped. Never mind. Let us leave it, and go.' 'Where shall we go?' asked Merry. 'To my home, or one of my homes,' answered Treebeard. 'Is it far?' 'I do not know. You might call it far, perhaps. But what does that matter?' 'Well, you see, we have lost all our belongings,' said Merry. 'We have only a little food.' 'O! Hm! You need not trouble about that,' said Treebeard. 'I can give you a drink that will keep you green and growing for a long, long while. And if we decide to part company, I can set you down outside my country at any point you choose. Let us go!' Holding the hobbits gently but firmly, one in the crook of each arm, Treebeard lifted up first one large foot and then the other, and moved them to the edge of the shelf. The rootlike toes grasped the rocks. Then carefully and solemnly, he stalked down from step to step, and reached the floor of the Forest. At once he set off with long deliberate strides through the trees, deeper and deeper into the wood, never far from the stream, climbing steadily up towards the slopes of the mountains.
