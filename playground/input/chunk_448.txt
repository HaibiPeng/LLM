And now there were eight mounds on the east-side of the Barrowfield. Then the Riders of the King's House upon white horses rode round about the barrow and sang together a song of Th�oden Thengel's son that Gl�owine his minstrel made, and he made no other song after. The slow voices of the Riders stirred the hearts even of those who did not know the speech of that people; but the words of the song brought a light to the eyes of the folk of the Mark as they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves of the North and the voice of Eorl crying above the battle upon the Field of Celebrant; and the tale of the kings rolled on, and the horn of Helm was loud in the mountains, until the Darkness came and King Th�oden arose and rode through the Shadow to the fire, and died in splendour, even as the Sun, returning beyond hope, gleamed upon Mindolluin in the morning. _Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing. Hope he rekindled, and in hope ended; over death, over dread, over doom lifted out of loss, out of life, unto long glory._ But Merry stood at the foot of the green mound, and he wept, and when the song was ended he arose and cried: 'Th�oden King, Th�oden King! Farewell! As a father you were to me. for a little while. Farewell!' When the burial was over and the weeping of women was stilled, and Th�oden was left at last alone in his barrow, then folk gathered to the Golden Hall for the great feast and put away sorrow; for Th�oden had lived to full years and ended in honour no less than the greatest of his sires. And when the time came that in the custom of the Mark they should drink to the memory of the kings, �owyn Lady of Rohan came forth, golden as the sun and white as snow, and she bore a filled cup to �omer. Then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and named all the names of the Lords of the Mark in their order: Eorl the Young; and Brego builder of the Hall; and Aldor brother of Baldor the hapless; and Fr�a, and Fr�awine, and Goldwine, and D�or, and Gram; and Helm who lay hid in Helm's Deep when the Mark was overrun; and so ended the nine mounds of the west-side, for in that time the line was broken, and after came the mounds of the east-side: Fr�alaf, Helm s sister-son, and L�ofa, and Walda, and Folca, and Folcwine, and Fengel, and Thengel, and Th�oden the latest. And when Th�oden was named �omer drained the cup. Then �owyn bade those that served to fill the cups, and all there assembled rose and drank to the new king, crying: 'Hail, �omer, King of the Mark!' At the last when the feast drew to an end �omer arose and said: 'Now this is the funeral feast of Th�oden the King; but I will speak ere we go of tidings of joy, for he would not grudge that I should do so, since he was ever a father of �owyn my sister. Hear then all my guests, fair folk of many realms, such as have never before been gathered in this hall! Faramir, Steward of Gondor, and Prince of Ithilien, asks that �owyn Lady of Rohan should be his wife, and she grants it full willing. Therefore they shall be trothplighted before you all.' And Faramir and �owyn stood forth and set hand in hand; and all there drank to them and were glad. 'Thus,' said �omer, 'is the friendship of the Mark and of Gondor bound with a new bond, and the more do I rejoice.' 'No niggard are you, �omer,' said Aragorn, 'to give thus to Gondor the fairest thing in your realm!' Then �owyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and she said: 'Wish me joy, my liege-lord and healer!' And he answered: 'I have wished thee joy ever since first I saw thee. It heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.' When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King �omer. Aragorn and his knights, and the people of L�rien and of Rivendell, made ready to ride; but Faramir and Imrahil remained at Edoras; and Arwen Evenstar remained also, and she said farewell to her brethren. None saw her last meeting with Elrond her father, for they went up into the hills and there spoke long together, and bitter was their parting that should endure beyond the ends of the world. At the last before the guests set oat �omer and �owyn came to Merry, and they said: 'Farewell now, Meriadoc of the Shire and Holdwine of the Mark! Ride to good fortune, and ride back soon to our welcome!' And �omer said: 'Kings of old would have laden you with gifts that a wain could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of Mundburg; and yet you will take naught, you say, but the arms that were given to you. This I suffer, for indeed I have no gift that is worthy; but my sister begs you to receive this small thing, as a memorial of Dernhelm and of the horns of the Mark at the coming of the morning.' Then �owyn gave to Merry an ancient horn, small but cunningly wrought all of fair silver with a baldric of green; and wrights had engraven upon it swift horsemen riding in a line that wound about it from the tip to the mouth; and there were set runes of great virtue. 'This is an heirloom of our house,' said �owyn. 'It was made by the Dwarves, and came from the hoard of Scatha the Worm. Eorl the Young brought it from the North. He that blows it at need shall set fear in the hearts of his enemies and joy in the hearts of his friends, and they shall hear him and come to him.' Then Merry took the horn, for it could not be refused, and he kissed �owyn's hand; and they embraced him, and so they parted for that time.
