Always the poor Uruks to put slips right, and small thanks. But don't forget: the enemies don't love us any more than they love Him, and if they get topsides on Him, we're done too. But see here: when were you ordered out? ' `About an hour ago, just before you saw us. A message came: _Nazg�l uneasy. Spies feared on Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to head of Stairs_. I came at once.' 'Bad business,' said Gorbag. `See here � our Silent Watchers were uneasy more than two days ago. that I know. But my patrol wasn't ordered out for another day, nor any message sent to Lugb�rz either: owing to the Great Signal going up, and the High Nazg�l going off to the war, and all that. And then they couldn't get Lugb�rz to pay attention for a good while, I'm told.' `The Eye was busy elsewhere, I suppose,' said Shagrat. `Big things going on away west, they say.' 'I daresay,' growled Gorbag. `But in the meantime enemies have got up the Stairs. And what were you up to? You're supposed to keep watch, aren't you, special orders or no? What are you for?' `That's enough! Don't try and teach me my job. We were awake all right. We knew there were funny things going on.' `Very funny! ' `Yes, very funny: lights and shouting and all. But Shelob was on the go. My lads saw her and her Sneak.' `Her Sneak? What's that? ' `You must have seen him: little thin black fellow; like a spider himself, or perhaps more like a starved frog. He's been here before. Came _out_ of Lugb�rz the first time, years ago, and we had word from High Up to let him pass. He's been up the Stairs once or twice since then, but we've left him alone: seems to have some understanding with Her Ladyship. I suppose he's no good to eat: she wouldn't worry about words from High Up. But a fine guard you keep in the valley: he was up here a day before all this racket. Early last night we saw him. Anyway my lads reported that Her Ladyship was having some fun, and that seemed good enough for me, until the message came. I thought her Sneak had brought her a toy. or that you'd perhaps sent her a present, a prisoner of war or something. I don't interfere when she's playing. Nothing gets by Shelob when she's on the hunt.' 'Nothing, say you! Didn't you use your eyes back there? I tell you I'm not easy in my mind. Whatever came up the Stairs, _did_ get by. It cut her web and got clean out of the hole. That's something to think about! ' `Ah well, but she got him in the end, didn't she? ' `_Got_ him? Got _who_? This little fellow? But if he was the only one then she'd have had him off to her larder long before, and there he'd be now. And if Lugb�rz wanted him, _you'd_ have to go and get him. Nice for you. But there was more than one.' At this point Sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear against the stone. 'Who cut the cords she'd put round him, Shagrat? Same one as cut the web. Didn't you see that? And who stuck a pin into Her Ladyship? Same one, I reckon. And where is he? Where is he, Shagrat? ' Shagrat made no reply. `You may well put your thinking cap on, if you've got one. It's no laughing matter. No one, no one has ever stuck a pin in Shelob before, as you should know well enough. There's no grief in that; but think-there's someone loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel that ever walked since the bad old times, since the Great Siege. Something _has_ slipped.' `And what is it then? ' growled Shagrat. `By all the signs, Captain Shagrat, I'd say there's a large warrior loose, Elf most likely, with an elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well maybe: and he's loose in your bounds, too, and you've never spotted him. Very funny indeed! ' Gorbag spat. Sam smiled grimly at this description of himself. 'Ah well, you always did take a gloomy view.' said Shagrat. 'You can read the signs how you like, but there may be other ways to explain them. Anyhow. I've got watchers at every point, and I'm going to deal with one thing at a time. When I've had a look at the fellow we _have_ caught, then I'll begin to worry about something else.' `It's my guess you won't find much in that little fellow,' said Gorbag. 'He may have had nothing to do with the real mischief. The big fellow with the sharp sword doesn't seem to have thought him worth much anyhow � just left him lying: regular elvish trick.' `We'll see. Come on now! We've talked enough. Let's go and have a look at the prisoner! `What are you going to do with him? Don't forget I spotted him first. If there's any game, me and my lads must be in it.' 'Now, now,' growled Shagrat. 'I have my orders. And it's more than my belly's worth, or yours, to break 'em. _Any_ trespasser found by the guard is to be held at the tower. Prisoner is to be stripped. Full description of every article, garment, weapon, letter, ring. or trinket is to be sent to Lugb�rz at once, and to Lugb�rz _only_. And the prisoner is to be kept safe and intact, under pain of death for every member of the guard, until He sends or comes Himself. That's plain enough, and that's what I'm going to do.' 'Stripped, eh? ' said Gorbag. 'What, teeth, nails, hair, and all? ' `No, none of that. He's for Lugb�rz, I tell you. He's wanted safe and whole.' 'You'll find that difficult,' laughed Gorbag. 'He's nothing but carrion now. What Lugb�rz will do with such stuff I can't guess.
