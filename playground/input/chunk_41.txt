'Come and have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. I did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.' Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat. 'What is the plan for today?' asked Pippin. 'To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,' answered Frodo, and gave his attention to the food. 'Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders?' asked Pippin cheerfully. Under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of them did not seem very alarming to him. 'Yes, probably,' said Frodo, not liking the reminder. 'But I hope to get across the river without their seeing us.' 'Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?' 'Not much � only hints and riddles,' said Frodo evasively. 'Did you ask about the sniffing?' 'We didn't discuss it,' said Frodo with his mouth full. 'You should have. I am sure it is very important.' 'In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain it,' said Frodo sharply. 'And now leave me in peace for a bit! I don't want to answer a string of questions while I am eating. I want to think!' 'Good heavens!' said Pippin. 'At breakfast?' He walked away towards the edge of the green. From Frodo's mind the bright morning � treacherously bright, he thought � had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor. The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was running on the green turf and singing. 'No! I could not!' he said to himself. 'It is one thing to take my young friends walking over the Shire with me, until we are hungry and weary, and food and bed are sweet. To take them into exile, where hunger and weariness may have no cure, is quite another � even if they are willing to come. The inheritance is mine alone. I don't think I ought even to take Sam.' He looked at Sam Gamgee, and discovered that Sam was watching him. 'Well, Sam!' he said. 'What about it? I am leaving the Shire as soon as ever I can � in fact I have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at Crickhollow, if it can be helped.' 'Very good, sir!' 'You still mean to come with me?' 'I do.' 'It is going to be very dangerous, Sam. 'It is already dangerous. Most likely neither of us will come back.' 'If you don't come back, sir, then I shan't, that's certain,' said Sam. _'Don't you leave him!_ they said to me. _Leave him!_ I said. _I never mean to. I am going with him, if he climbs to the Moon, and if any of those Black Rulers try to stop him, they'll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with,_ I said. They laughed.' 'Who are _they,_ and what are you talking about?' 'The Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and they seemed to know you were going away, so I didn't see the use of denying it. Wonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!' 'They are,' said Frodo. 'Do you like them still, now you have had a closer view?' 'They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,' answered Sam slowly. 'It don't seem to matter what I think about them. They are quite different from what I expected � so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it were.' Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him. It did not sound like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he knew. But it looked like the old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except that his face was unusually thoughtful. 'Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now � now that your wish to see them has come true already?' he asked. 'Yes, sir. I don't know how to say it, but after last night I feel different. I seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. I know we are going to take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn back. It isn't to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want � I don't rightly know what I want: but I have something to do before the end, and it lies ahead, not in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me.' 'I don't altogether. But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion. I am content. We will go together.' Frodo finished his breakfast in silence. Then standing up he looked over the land ahead, and called to Pippin. 'All ready to start?' he said as Pippin ran up. 'We must be getting off at once. We slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.' _'You_ slept late, you mean,' said Pippin. 'I was up long before; and we are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.' 'I have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry as quickly as possible. I am not going out of the way, back to the road we left last night: I am going to cut straight across country from here.' 'Then you are going to fly,' said Pippin. 'You won't cut straight on foot anywhere in this country.' 'We can cut straighter than the road anyway,' answered Frodo. 'The Ferry is east from Woodhall; but the hard road curves away to the left -you can see a bend of it away north over there. It goes round the north end of the Marish so as to strike the causeway from the Bridge above Stock. But that is miles out of the way. We could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the Ferry from where we stand.' _'Short cuts make long delays,'_ argued Pippin.
